# Genius Python Game

![genius](genius.png)

Here is my version of the game Simon Says, but in Brazil is called Genius, so here it is, my version of Genius.

## Requirements:
To run this game you need:

- Python 3.6.x or a newer version.

## How to play
To play this game you need to:

- Open your terminal (Linux and MAC) or CMD (Windows)
- Execute the file with ./main.py or python main.py
- Genius will give you 3 starting colors between the 4 options: Red (R), Blue (B), Green (G) and Yellow (Y)
- To win you have to input the colors correctly and in the same order that Genius gives you
- It only stops when you miss or uses CTRL + C

### Have Fun!

It's simple, but is honest work.
